# proj5-mongo
Simple list of dated memos kept in MongoDB database

## What is here

I have a website that shows the create Memo page, with a text field for date and one for the body of the memo.
The page also shows all memos in the database correctly.
I ran out of time attempting to debug the adding of memos. It shows an internal server error when a memo is added, and the add fails.

The page can be reached with the fowllowing URL: http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu:port_num/ where port_num is the random port that main.py is running on.
